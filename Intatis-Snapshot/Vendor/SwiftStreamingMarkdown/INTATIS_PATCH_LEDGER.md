# Intatis SwiftStreamingMarkdown Vendored Patch Ledger

> **PERMANENT PROVENANCE RECORD.** Keep this file beside the vendored source,
> update it whenever the upstream basis or local patches change, and retain the
> Microsoft MIT license in `LICENSE`.

This ledger describes the Intatis-maintained vendored derivative of Microsoft
SwiftStreamingMarkdown. The vendored snapshot lives at
`Vendor/SwiftStreamingMarkdown` and is versioned by the containing Intatis Git
revision. It is third-party-derived code, not independently authored Intatis
renderer code.

## Provenance and toolchain contract

- Upstream tag: `v0.6.0`
- Upstream commit: `c7b12f7b3d77caa188fd1fc056d0f7ce305ef5cd`
- Package tools contract: Swift tools 6.2 or newer; Swift language mode 6
- Intended Apple toolchain: Xcode 26 or newer
- Supported deployment targets: macOS 14 or newer and iOS 16 or newer
- Direct package dependency: `swift-markdown` 0.8.0,
  revision `3c6f9523da3a1ec2fd829673e472d95b8097a3b8`
- Transitive parser dependency: `swift-cmark` 0.8.0,
  revision `924936d0427cb25a61169739a7660230bffa6ea6`
- Direct Apple-platform math dependency: `iosMath` 2.5.0,
  revision `838cddc01fdd67efd530f8bb67959ad2715f9b06`, conditioned
  on iOS and macOS; iosMath has no transitive package dependency

`swift-markdown` 0.8.0 itself uses a Swift 6.2 tools manifest but explicitly
declares `swiftLanguageModes: [.v5]`. The derivative is Swift 6; the parser
dependency is compiled in its declared Swift 5 mode. Do not globally override
the complete dependency graph to Swift 6: doing so exposes upstream Sendable
errors and is not a supported validation configuration.

Do not advertise Swift 6.0 compatibility. The public ownership-transfer API
uses `@concurrent`, so the package manifest and consumer documentation must
retain the Swift 6.2+ requirement.

## Patch groups

### 1. Initial dependency and resource thinning

Paths:

- `Package.swift`
- `Package.resolved`
- `README.md`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Resources/Assets.xcassets/**` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Resources/Media.xcassets/**` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` (retained)

Changes and reason:

- The initial vendored import removed HighlightSwift, iosMath, Shimmer,
  SnapshotTesting, and their transitive first-release surface. Patch group 10
  later reintroduces only exact iosMath 2.5.0 for a new bounded inline-math
  path; the old regex preprocessor and the other removed packages remain
  absent.
- Pin `swift-markdown` exactly to 0.8.0 because its malformed-table handling is
  required by the retained table path.
- Remove branded color/media assets instead of compiling or excluding dead
  payload. The derivative-owned SwiftPM bundle contains only `Info.plist` and
  `Localizable.xcstrings`; Xcode compiles the same catalog to localized
  `*.lproj/Localizable.strings`. Neither form may contain image/color assets.
  iosMath owns a separate `iosMath_iosMath.bundle`; its eight OpenType fonts,
  math tables, license texts, README files, and conversion script are audited
  third-party resources rather than derivative-owned media assets.

Regression obligations:

- Resolve from an empty package cache using the pinned graph.
- Inventory both the derivative localization bundle and
  `iosMath_iosMath.bundle` after macOS and iOS Release builds.
- Preserve MIT and dependency notices in the consuming application.

### 2. Audited ownership-transfer boundary

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/MarkdownParser.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/MarkdownParserImpl.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/RenderableDocument.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MarkdownRenderable.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MarkdownRenderConfig.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Style/TextFonts.swift`
- font/configuration support files under `Sources/MarkdownText/**`

Changes and reason:

- Make `MarkdownDocumentParser.parse(text:config:)` an `@concurrent`
  operation taking `sending MarkdownRenderConfig` and returning
  `sending RenderableDocument`.
- Construct the parser locally in the worker and transfer the completed result
  once to a receiving `@MainActor` owner.
- Make `RenderableDocument` a non-`Sendable` final class. A copyable struct
  wrapper around mutable attributed-string references does not provide an
  identity-level transfer guarantee.
- Remove all package-owned `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, and
  `@preconcurrency` escape hatches.
- Keep the parser and renderable document out of actors, AsyncStreams, and
  scheduler state. A scheduler may hold only Sendable permits/generations while
  the awaiting task retains its candidate locally.

Regression obligations:

- Strict Swift 6.2 Release compile with complete concurrency checking,
  concurrency warnings, and warnings as errors.
- A headless probe must parse off-main, cross a Sendable-only gate, then install
  the document on the main actor.
- A source scan must find no package-owned unchecked/unsafe concurrency marker.

### 3. Main-actor compatibility controllers

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/MarkdownView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/StreamedMarkdownView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Utilities/MarkdownListener.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/DocumentView.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Isolate convenience controllers/listeners to `@MainActor`.
- Remove the document-bearing `AsyncStream`; render callbacks are synchronous
  on the main actor.
- Route convenience views through the internal `parseOnMain` compatibility
  path so caller-supplied fonts and display configuration are preserved.
- Reserve the public `@concurrent` transfer boundary for Intatis' external
  parse scheduler. Intatis must own the result on `@MainActor` and retain a
  distinct display configuration.

Regression obligations:

- Verify a custom platform paragraph font survives the convenience-view path.
- Verify streamed updates cannot retain or forward documents through an
  AsyncStream or actor mailbox.

### 4. Features disabled at the initial cutover

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/MarkdownParseOption.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/LaTexPreProcessor.swift` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/LatexAttachmentData.swift` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/BlockMathView.swift` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/LatexViewProvider.swift` (deleted)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/HighlightTaskManager.swift` (deleted)
- math/highlight branches in block, inline, config, and view sources

Changes and reason:

- At the initial cutover, delete the upstream regex-based math implementation
  and all syntax-highlighting implementations and APIs. Patch group 10 added
  a smaller request-local, code-aware single-dollar path without restoring
  those files; patch group 12 supersedes only that path's delimiter and
  admission policy. Syntax highlighting remains deleted.
- Force animation, citations, and images off in
  `firstReleaseParseConfiguration()` for the production off-main parser.
- Keep any still-compiled legacy image/citation compatibility source out of the
  Intatis production parse profile; it is not a first-release capability.

Regression obligations:

- Contract-test the forced-off production parse configuration.
- Scan the production dependency graph and source tree for every removed
  optional runtime and branded asset, allowing only the exact iosMath identity
  recorded in patch group 10.

### 5. Native code-copy control and accessibility

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/CodeBlockView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/CodeBlockConfig.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Replace the gesture-only copy target with a real SwiftUI `Button`, plain
  style, content shape, and accessibility label.
- Preserve byte-exact clipboard writes and the existing copy callback.
- Reduce code-block configuration to retained chrome foreground/background
  colors; remove highlight-theme CSS.
- Neutralize the private select-more context-menu sentinel from the upstream
  reverse-DNS brand to `SwiftStreamingMarkdown.textSelection.selectMore`. The
  value is internal routing state, not a persisted/public identifier, so no
  compatibility reason justifies retaining `com.microsoft` in the derivative.

Regression obligations:

- Source contract verifies `Button`, plain style, accessibility label, exact
  platform clipboard calls, and absence of `onTapGesture` in the copy control.
- Manual VoiceOver and keyboard activation remain required before release.

### 6. Zero native-view retention cache

Path:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/ParagraphViewCache.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Set the retention budget to exactly zero: every request creates a fresh
  native paragraph view and `clearCache()` is a no-op.
- This removes `ParagraphViewCache` itself as a retention source. It does not
  prove that the surrounding SwiftUI/TextKit/AppKit/UIKit view graph has
  bounded memory: repeated representable recreation can still allocate fresh
  native views faster than the framework releases prior graph generations.

Regression obligations:

- Assert two cache requests return distinct native view identities.
- Treat a zero cache as one ownership boundary, not as a whole-view-graph
  memory proof. Measure long-session memory, CPU, recreation rate, and
  scrolling on representative macOS hardware; the policy trades cache
  retention for additional allocation work when a parent graph is unstable.

### 7. Swift 6 actor/lifecycle hardening

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/ContextMenu/TextContextMenu.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/TextTransition/FadeInTextTransitionViewModifier.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/OrderedListView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/TableView.swift`
- paragraph AppKit/UIKit sources
- deprecated change-observer call sites under `Sources/MarkdownText/**`

Changes and reason:

- Main-actor isolate platform UI operations and context-menu construction.
- Main-actor isolate the Debug-only mutable-attributed-string table fixtures;
  this fixes their Swift 6 shared-global diagnostic without changing table
  layout or production behavior.
- Use isolated deinitializers for native paragraph views.
- Compute platform-font metrics before Sendable closures.
- Replace deprecated change observers with task identity where appropriate.

Regression obligations:

- macOS and iOS strict Release builds with warnings treated as errors.
- Lifecycle stress testing while rapidly replacing streamed documents.

### 8. View diff, layout invalidation, and selection-overlay hardening

The AppKit width-invalidation portion of this patch group is historical and
is superseded by patch group 11. UIKit retains the patch-group-8 contract.

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/DocumentView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/AppKit/ParagraphView+macOS.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/AppKit/ParagraphNSView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/UIKit/ParagraphView+iOS.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/UIKit/ParagraphUIView.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/TableView.swift`
- `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Sources/MessageRendering/IntatisMessageContentView.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphNSViewTests.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphUIViewTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ViewEquatableContractTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/FirstReleaseContractTests.swift`
- `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Tests/MessageRenderingTests.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Restore hand-written `Equatable` conformances for `DocumentView` and the
  AppKit/UIKit `ParagraphView` representables. These preserve the upstream
  `@Equatable` diffing semantics without restoring the removed macro
  dependency: controller state is ignored, while document/configuration or
  paragraph contents/line spacing remain part of equality.
- Track the last valid laid-out paragraph width independently from the
  intrinsic-size cache. A stable positive width does not repeatedly invalidate
  intrinsic size; zero, negative, NaN, and infinite widths clear the width
  tracker without invalidating. Returning through
  `valid -> zero -> same valid` therefore forces exactly one fresh measurement
  instead of either retaining a screen-width fallback or opening a stable-zero
  invalidation path. The AppKit and UIKit implementations have the same
  contract.
- Remove the Intatis facade's whole-rich-document
  `.textSelection(.enabled)` modifier. Native paragraph views remain directly
  selectable, while selection for plain fallback text and SwiftUI-only table
  and code text is retained at those leaf views. This avoids wrapping native
  selectable paragraph representables in a second SwiftUI `SelectionOverlay`
  without silently dropping the product selection contract.

Regression obligations:

- Assert `DocumentView` equality ignores its controller and tracks document
  plus configuration; assert both platform paragraph wrappers track attributed
  contents plus line spacing.
- Count intrinsic-size invalidations across stable positive width, stable zero
  width, a real width change, and `valid -> zero -> same valid` on both AppKit
  and UIKit.
- Source-contract test that the rich facade has no whole-document selection
  modifier, while plain fallback, table text leaves, and code text retain
  selection.
- Passing unit tests are necessary but not sufficient: repeat bounded,
  watchdog-controlled on-window memory/CPU validation before changing the
  release disposition below.

### 9. Test-suite routing

Paths:

- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/FirstReleaseContractTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphNSViewTests.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphUIViewTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ViewEquatableContractTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/MarkdownParserTests.swift`
- retained focused parser, link, task-list, TextKit, and rewrite tests
- obsolete optional-feature/snapshot tests and `__Snapshots__/**` (deleted)

Changes and reason:

- Compile every remaining test source; do not hide files with a manifest
  allowlist or `exclude` gate.
- At initial cutover, replace removed
  math/image/citation/highlight/snapshot suites with focused first-release
  ownership, profile, zero-cache, code-copy, table, font, and parser
  contracts. Patch group 10 adds new formula-specific coverage without
  restoring the removed suites.
- Cover the restored view-diff guards, stable-width/zero-width layout
  invalidation contract, and selection-overlay ownership described above.
- Snapshot image deletions are mechanical repository thinning and must be
  counted separately from renderer implementation changes.

Regression obligations:

- Run the full retained Release suite under strict concurrency and warnings as
  errors on macOS.
- Add Intatis-level golden rendering, streaming replacement, selection/copy,
  tables, accessibility, and memory/performance coverage before cutover.
- Keep large SwiftUI host tests offscreen in headless XCTest. The same
  on-window teardown pattern reproduces an optimized-XCTest `objc_release`
  crash in both the reference matrix and derivative matrix. That comparison
  invalidates the headless `NSWindow` harness; it is not evidence attributing a
  renderer defect to either implementation. Validate real window open/close in
  a signed GUI host through Computer Use.

### 10. Code-aware single-dollar inline math

Historical note: this section records the 2026-07-24 implementation exactly as
introduced. Patch group 12 supersedes its delimiter exclusions, 32-formula /
8-KiB admission caps, and 1024×256-point attachment cap.

Paths:

- `Package.swift`
- `Package.resolved`
- `README.md`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MathRenderConfig.swift` (added)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/InlineMathCatalog.swift` (added)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MathAttachmentData.swift` (added)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/InlineMathPreprocessor.swift` (added)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/InlineMathAttachment.swift` (added)
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MarkdownRenderConfig.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MarkdownRenderConfig+Builders.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/RenderableDocument.swift`

- `Sources/MarkdownText/Inline/Markdown+InlineConvertible.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Block/BlockQuote+.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Block/Table+.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/ContextMenu/TextContextMenu.swift`

- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathAttachmentTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathParserTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathPreprocessorTests.swift` (added)
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphNSViewTests.swift`
- retained parser/config/contract tests under `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/**`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Sources/MessageRendering/IntatisMessageContentView.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Sources/MessageRendering/IntatisMicrosoftMarkdownPipeline.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Tests/MessageRenderingTests.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Apps/IntatisMac/Sources/RendererFixtureView.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `scripts/RendererValidationWatchdog.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Package.resolved`, `project.yml`, `NOTICE.md`, and
  `ThirdPartyNotices/{MarkdownRendering,MathRendering}.md`

Changes and reason:

- Add exact iosMath 2.5.0 as an iOS/macOS-only product dependency. The pinned
  tag resolves to commit `838cddc01fdd67efd530f8bb67959ad2715f9b06`;
  iosMath has no transitive package dependency.
- Support a normal paired single-dollar delimiter for inline math while
  preserving fenced code, inline code spans, escaped dollars, malformed or
  incomplete input, unsupported delimiter forms, and non-formula currency
  cases as literal source.
- Cap admission at 32 formulas per message and 8 KiB UTF-8 bytes per
  formula. Exceeding either limit leaves every candidate in that message
  literal rather than producing a partial attachment set.
- Keep `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, and `\[...\]` outside the first formula
  profile. Do not restore the deleted `LaTexPreProcessor.swift`,
  `LatexAttachmentData.swift`, `BlockMathView.swift`, or
  `LatexViewProvider.swift`.
- Preserve raw TeX source beside any native attachment for fallback,
  selection/copy, and accessibility. Formula rendering remains a disposable
  display projection and cannot rewrite EventLog/provider content.
- Keep the existing off-main Markdown parse and single-owner MainActor
  document boundary. iosMath's native label parse/update is UI-bound and must
  be budgeted explicitly; it is not `Sendable` work and must not be hidden in
  the process-wide parser scheduler.
- Host accepted formulas through a live TextKit 2
  `NSTextAttachmentViewProvider` whose view is `MTMathUILabel`. Preflight each
  label on MainActor, cap it at 1024×256 points, and restore exact literal
  source when layout is invalid or out of bounds. Do not generate or retain a
  raster preview/cache. Resolve semantic foreground color from the live
  AppKit/UIKit appearance and include the caller's Dynamic Type typography in
  Intatis' display revision so an old-size attachment cannot overwrite a
  newer request.
- Preserve attachment-aware final output in headings, lists, block quotes,
  and tables. Their copy and accessibility projections must restore either
  exact source or the localized formula label rather than leaking private
  tokens or U+FFFC.
- Keep `.plainSafe` as a complete bypass before any Markdown or math parser is
  constructed. Images, citations, animation, syntax highlighting, table
  actions, and non-HTTP(S)/mailto links retain their existing first-release
  policy.
- Treat iosMath's eight unmodified OpenType fonts and accompanying math-table,
  license, README, and script files as a separate audited resource bundle.
  They do not replace or determine Intatis' product-interface font.

Regression obligations:

- Delimiter tests must cover prose, streaming incomplete/complete transitions,
  escapes, inline/fenced code, currency and unmatched dollars, adjacency,
  malformed TeX, and the literal block/bracket/parenthesis forms.
- Selection, clipboard, and accessibility must preserve the original formula
  source rather than an empty object-replacement character.
- Strict macOS Debug/Release, iOS compile/build, dependency-resolution, notice,
  and final-bundle inventory checks must use the exact pinned graph. A
  distributed app must expose iosMath MIT plus GUST/LPPL and OFL terms.
- Compare the same Microsoft renderer with math disabled and enabled; a
  plain-safe run is not a valid no-math performance baseline.
- Run the existing single-instance, hash-pinned hard-watchdog containment
  stages before any long interaction/soak protocol. Formula count, stream
  replacement, Light/Dark, selection/copy, accessibility, main-thread stalls,
  RSS/footprint, and cleanup remain release gates. Existing adverse renderer
  evidence remains authoritative until those gates pass.

Dependency-only audit evidence:

- The Intatis root and derivative `Package.resolved` files currently agree on
  iosMath 2.5.0 at revision
  `838cddc01fdd67efd530f8bb67959ad2715f9b06`.
- At the exact iosMath revision, macOS SwiftPM Debug and Release,
  compile-only `swift build --build-tests`, and unsigned iOS Simulator Release
  builds passed with Swift 6.3.3 / Xcode 26.6.
- Upstream test executables were not run. These compile-only checks do not
  validate this derivative's delimiter, UI, accessibility, streaming, or
  performance behavior.
- The isolated iOS product copied the 26-file, 7,234,424-byte `fonts/`
  payload byte-for-byte: 8 OTF files, 8 math-table plist files, 5 license
  files, 4 README files, and `math_table_to_plist.py`. The complete built
  resource bundle has 27 files because Xcode/SwiftPM generates a root
  `Info.plist`.
- The 2026-07-24 derivative `swift test --disable-sandbox` run passed 75
  XCTest tests and 7 Swift Testing tests (82 total). Final macOS/iOS products,
  bundle inventory, executable hash and controlled short GUI validation were
  also reproduced as separate evidence below; long soak and real
  selection/clipboard/VoiceOver remain separate release gates.

### 11. macOS paragraph width ownership and bounded measurement

Paths:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/AppKit/ParagraphView+macOS.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/AppKit/ParagraphNSView.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ParagraphNSViewTests.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/ViewEquatableContractTests.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Make the SwiftUI proposal the sole horizontal size owner on macOS.
  `ParagraphNSView` now reports `NSView.noIntrinsicMetric` for width while
  retaining a width-validated intrinsic height.
- `ParagraphView.sizeThatFits` returns the exact finite positive proposal
  width and the measured TextKit height. It no longer feeds glyph used width
  back into SwiftUI layout.
- Bounds-width changes clear the local height measurement and schedule TextKit
  2 viewport layout, but no longer call `invalidateIntrinsicContentSize`.
  Content and line-spacing changes may still invalidate intrinsic height.
- Replace the unbounded historical-width dictionary with a one-entry
  exact-width/height memo. No rounding or width bucketing is allowed because
  adjacent proposals may cross a line-wrap boundary.
- This supersedes the AppKit width-invalidation portion of patch group 8.
  UIKit retains the patch-group-8 contract.

Regression obligations:

- 10,000 changing widths produce zero width-driven intrinsic invalidations.
- 10,000 cache stores retain exactly one entry.
- Adjacent exact widths do not alias.
- Intrinsic height is validated against the current width.
- A live `NSHostingView` survives repeated A-B-A width cycles with finite,
  reversible paragraph geometry.
- Repeat strict Release warnings-as-errors and real on-window zoom/scroll
  validation.

Current patch-group-11 evidence (2026-07-30):

- Strict Release warnings-as-errors passed with 77 XCTest tests and 11 Swift
  Testing tests, zero failures.
- The same final validation executable completed three 180-second rich
  `CodeShell` soaks. All three passed memory plateau, heartbeat,
  multiple-updates-per-frame, process cleanup, exact 1,249-delta/17-message
  final input, and two session switches; the first two no-AX runs recorded zero
  invalid geometry.
- A normal Release product build completed the real issue-session A-B-A,
  zoom/restore, scroll, and multiwindow matrix without reproducing the
  paragraph layout hang.
- A roughly 90-second final-executable Hangs/Time Profiler capture reported
  zero Potential Hang rows and zero Hang Risk rows. It still sampled short
  ordinary layout bursts, so this is not a claim that layout work disappeared.
- The interactive Computer Use soak recorded 18 AppKit negative-geometry
  issues in the Intatis PID. Each cluster immediately followed system
  ThemeWidget/AX/ReplayKit activation, while two identical no-AX runs recorded
  zero. Preserve the count as automation-correlated evidence; do not describe
  the interactive runtime audit as all-zero or globally ignore future
  uncorrelated geometry faults.

### 12. Common LaTeX delimiters without derivative formula caps

Paths:

- `README.md`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MathRenderConfig.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/InlineMathCatalog.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Models/MathAttachmentData.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/Parser/InlineMathPreprocessor.swift`
- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/Paragraph/InlineMathAttachment.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathAttachmentTests.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathParserTests.swift`
- `Tests/MarkdownTextTests/InlineMathPreprocessorTests.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Sources/MessageRendering/IntatisMicrosoftMarkdownPipeline.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Packages/IntatisSharedUI/Tests/MessageRenderingTests.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `Apps/IntatisMac/Sources/{IntatisChatScreen,RendererFixtureView}.swift`
- containing Intatis revision:
  `NOTICE.md`, `ThirdPartyNotices/{MarkdownRendering,MathRendering}.md`, and
  the renderer sections of `docs/**`

Changes and reason:

- Replace the single-dollar-only mode with one code-aware LaTeX mode that
  recognizes `$...$` and `\(...\)` as inline math, plus `$$...$$` and
  `\[...\]` as display math. Display delimiters may span lines.
- Preserve the existing first raw Markdown AST as the authority for fenced
  code, inline code, link/image, autolink, and raw-HTML protection. The
  request-local token catalog and exact-source copy/accessibility projection
  remain unchanged.
- Remove the derivative's 32-formula-per-message and 8-KiB-per-formula
  admission caps. Accepted candidates are no longer switched as a group to
  literal output because a local formula budget was crossed.
- Remove the derivative's 1024×256-point attachment cutoff. Preflight now
  accepts any finite, positive intrinsic size returned by iosMath; invalid TeX
  or invalid platform geometry still restores the exact source literal.
- Carry inline/display presentation through the request-local catalog and
  scalar attachment payload. Live `MTMathUILabel` views use `.text` for inline
  delimiters and `.display` for display delimiters.
- Do not restore the deleted upstream regex preprocessing or legacy block
  views, add a WebView/raster cache, change EventLog/provider source, or change
  the exact iosMath dependency and resource inventory.
- Intatis SharedUI's syntax-agnostic whole-message rich-admission boundary and
  process-wide parser scheduler backpressure are separate renderer resource
  controls; they are not formula-count or per-formula caps and are unchanged.

Regression obligations:

- Exercise all four delimiter forms, multiline display content, protected
  Markdown literals, currency/escape/malformed input, exact source
  restoration, and inline/display iosMath modes.
- Exercise more than 32 accepted formulas and formula source larger than the
  removed 8-KiB threshold without a literal-only admission fallback.
- Exercise a valid attachment wider than the removed 1024-point cutoff.
- Retain strict concurrency/build, source-copy/accessibility, Light/Dark,
  Dynamic Type, streaming replacement, memory, cancellation, and real-window
  validation gates.

Current patch-group-12 evidence (2026-07-31):

- `swift test --disable-sandbox --filter InlineMath` passed 39/39 focused
  tests with zero failures on macOS.
- The full derivative Release suite with strict concurrency warnings promoted
  to errors passed 79 XCTest + 11 Swift Testing tests (90/90 total).
- Root `MessageRenderingTests` passed 41/41; `swift build --disable-sandbox
  --target IntatisSharedUI`, `xcodegen generate`, IntatisMac macOS Debug, and
  IntatisiOS generic Simulator Debug all succeeded.
- The full root suite, Release app matrix, and user-approved real-window
  validation were not run for patch group 12. The automated evidence above
  does not by itself establish renderer release readiness.

### 13. Honor the existing render configuration in code-block chrome

Path:

- `Sources/MarkdownText/UI/CodeBlockView.swift`

Changes and reason:

- Replace the three direct `Typography` reads in the code block with the
  already supplied `MarkdownRenderConfig`: the code body uses
  `inlineStyle.codeTextFont`, while the language and Copy labels use
  `tableStyle.textFonts`.
- Default rendering is unchanged because the default configuration exposes
  the same `Typography.codeTextFonts.normal` and `Typography.smallTextFonts`
  values. The change only makes the package's existing public font
  configuration effective for these leaves.
- This is used by Intatis' JetBrains Mono product typography. No JetBrains
  resource, registration logic, or product-font policy is added to the
  vendored renderer itself.

Regression obligations:

- The vendor suite must confirm default code body/language/Copy rendering and
  byte-exact Copy behavior remain intact.
- A root integration test must confirm a caller-supplied code font reaches the
  code-block body through `MarkdownRenderConfig`.
- This patch must remain a use of the existing configuration API, not become a
  second typography registry inside the derivative.

2026-08-19 direct evidence:

- The complete vendor suite passed: 79 XCTest tests plus 11 Swift Testing
  tests, zero failures. The focused `FirstReleaseContractTests` subset was
  7/7 and now freezes both config-driven code/body labels and the existing
  native Copy contract.
- The consuming Intatis SharedUI typography/rendering/layout suites passed
  73/73. macOS and iOS Debug and Release app products built successfully; the
  Release macOS executable contains `x86_64 arm64`.
- This evidence validates the narrow configuration patch. The product-font
  decision remains owned by Intatis; device/accessibility gates stay open.

## Current validation evidence

Unless explicitly identified as patch-group-10 or patch-group-12 evidence
above, the renderer evidence below predates the relevant math change. It
remains a useful baseline for the earlier derivative but cannot be promoted
to current math-integration evidence. Re-run the same checks with Swift 6.3.3 / Xcode
26.6 whenever this vendored snapshot or any exact dependency pin changes.

- Post-hygiene `swift package dump-package` reports exactly one library
  product, one regular library target, and one test target; no executable
  product or target remains.
- Fresh post-hygiene macOS Debug and Release SwiftPM resolutions fetched the
  then-current two parser dependencies from an isolated local cache at their
  exact revisions. After the view-diff/layout/selection hardening in patch
  group 8, that pre-math snapshot reran strict concurrency, concurrency
  warnings, and Swift
  warnings-as-errors in both configurations. Each ran all 38 XCTest tests and
  six Swift Testing tests (44 total per configuration, zero failures).
- The retained suite plus Phase-2 corpus passed: malformed and streaming table
  prefixes; byte-exact LaTeX delimiters inside fenced/inline code; disabled
  image matrix; six link schemes; 100 KiB and 256 KiB Markdown; 71,680-byte
  code; offscreen large SwiftUI hosts; and light/dark/resize host lifecycle.
- A separate pre-math headless consumer resolved the local derivative plus the
  two exact parser pins from a fresh scratch directory, built strict Release
  with Swift warnings-as-errors, and printed `HEADLESS_CONSUMER_OK`.
- An independent minimal app rebuilt Release after release hygiene and had
  previously built Debug for `generic/platform=iOS` without signing, resolving
  the same exact graph. A separate arm64 iOS library-only SwiftPM build passed
  strict concurrency and Swift warnings-as-errors. The generic Xcode builds
  respect the dependency's declared Swift 5 language mode; they must not be
  described as all-dependencies Swift-6 builds.
- Before its required removal, the scratch-only output-free scheduler
  integration executable built under the same strict flags and printed
  `SENDING_BOUNDARY_OK`.
- Pre-math source scans found no package-owned unchecked/unsafe concurrency
  escape, removed optional runtime name, branded private identifier, or
  document-bearing AsyncStream/actor storage. Current scans must allow only the
  explicitly pinned iosMath dependency while retaining the other exclusions.

### Historical adverse GUI evidence and current release disposition

The 2026-07-18 on-window validation did **not** pass. Three
`Intatis Renderer Validation` instances were accidentally allowed to coexist.
The macOS Force Quit UI reported **129.63 GB of application memory** for the
dominant instance. That number is a macOS UI value; it must not be restated as
an exact RSS, footprint, or byte count.

System CPU diagnostic incident
`FA228932-2C40-4AC2-A0C2-62EF41342B4A` covers 160 seconds, records 90 seconds of
CPU use (about 56%), and shows its sampled footprint increasing from
109.16 MB to 803.30 MB. Heavy stacks include SwiftUICore, AttributeGraph, lazy
layout, `ParagraphView` copy/destruction, and `SelectionOverlay`. This proves
uncontrolled renderer/UI lifecycle growth in that validation process. It does
not identify the final retaining edge, and the root cause remains
**UNKNOWN**; attributing the incident solely to Microsoft, the parser,
Computer Use, or a particular Apple framework leak would overstate the
evidence.

Patch group 8 addressed a high-confidence amplification path: lost upstream
diff guards, stable-width intrinsic-size invalidation, and a duplicate rich
whole-document selection overlay. Patch group 10 additionally fixed the
math-era AppKit attachment lifecycle by retaining an explicit TextKit 2
content-storage/layout-manager/text-container network, restoring the primary
layout manager after replacing content, and coalescing viewport layout on the
next main turn. Neither patch identifies the final retaining edge from the
historical multi-instance incident.

The current 2026-07-24 short controlled evidence is positive:

- Vendor tests passed 82/82 and strict Release warnings-as-errors passed;
  SharedUI `MessageRenderingTests` passed 25/25; the root suite passed 938
  tests with 14 skipped and zero failures.
- IntatisMac Debug/Release and IntatisiOS generic Simulator Debug/Release
  products built successfully. The two app bundles each contain the audited
  eight OTF files and complete 26-file iosMath `fonts/` payload; their
  bundled `NOTICE.md` matches the repository notice.
- One hash-pinned validation executable ran the same Microsoft renderer with
  math disabled/enabled, then `math-one`, `math-thirty-two`, `math-history`
  and `math-stream`; every short run exited 0, required no TERM/KILL, passed
  double cleanup and left no process behind.
- Light and Dark Computer Use `math-structure` runs visibly rendered formulas
  in headings, paragraphs, both list kinds, block quotes and tables while
  protected `$not_math$` / `$table_code$` text stayed literal. The AX tree
  exposed original TeX formula descriptions.

These short runs supersede the old statement that the latest Computer Use
result was `FAIL / ABORTED`; they do not erase the historical incident or
establish release readiness. A >160-second single-instance soak, real
selection/clipboard-byte checks, real VoiceOver operation, minimum-supported
macOS runtime and representative iOS device validation remain open.

That sentence is the dated 2026-07-24 patch-group-10 boundary. The 2026-07-30
patch-group-11 evidence above subsequently completed three >160-second
single-instance soaks for the current macOS paragraph path. Real
selection/clipboard bytes, VoiceOver, minimum-supported macOS and
representative iOS devices remain open, as does the historical multi-instance
retaining edge.

Warm offscreen single-paragraph plain-text timings (parse plus host, six
Release samples across two test processes, each after an explicit 1 KiB
warm-up) were:

| Input | Median | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 16 KiB | 7.130 ms | 8.993 ms |
| 32 KiB | 12.276 ms | 12.612 ms |
| 48 KiB | 17.363 ms | 17.475 ms |
| 64 KiB | 22.214 ms | 22.374 ms |
| 96 KiB | 32.324 ms | 32.672 ms |

The first exploratory run without an in-process warm-up observed a 129.707 ms
16 KiB cold-start maximum. Also, byte count alone does not bound Markdown block
complexity: the 100 KiB and 256 KiB syntax-dense hosts took about 2.27 seconds
and 12.15 seconds respectively. A syntax-agnostic whole-message admission cap
therefore needs a conservative fallback policy; these plain-text figures are
not a general renderer latency guarantee.

## Upstream issue mapping

Only issues that materially intersect this patch are listed:

- `microsoft/SwiftStreamingMarkdown#73`: malformed/extra-pipe table parsing.
  The fork's `swift-markdown` 0.8.0 pin is part of the required fix evidence.
- `microsoft/SwiftStreamingMarkdown#124`: safely making font-holding
  configuration Sendable. This fork deliberately chooses non-Sendable config
  plus `sending` transfer instead of introducing an unchecked font wrapper.
- `microsoft/SwiftStreamingMarkdown#144`: asynchronous controller lifecycle.
  It motivates lifecycle work but does not by itself establish this fork's
  no-document-AsyncStream or ownership-transfer architecture.

New upstream issues or PRs should be proposed for:

- a non-copyable-in-practice `sending` parser/document ownership boundary;
- removal of renderable documents from AsyncStream/controller mailboxes;
- configurable paragraph-view cache budget, including zero;
- an accessible native code-copy button;
- a supported dependency-minimal feature/resource profile;
- strict Swift 6.2 concurrency without unchecked escape hatches.

Do not claim upstream coverage from issue numbers whose exact relevance has not
been verified.

## Import and release-hygiene disposition

The following compiler/integration probe artifacts were local evidence and
have been removed from the package before final validation; they must not be
restored or shipped in the vendored library package:

- `SendingProbe.swift`
- `StructAliasProbe.swift`
- `IntegrationProbe.swift`
- `IntegrationNegativeProbe.swift`
- `ProbeExecutable/**`
- the `SendingIntegrationProbe` executable product/target in `Package.swift`

The vendored package includes
`Tests/MarkdownTextTests/CandidatePhase2MatrixTests.swift` and
`Tests/MarkdownTextTests/FirstReleaseContractTests.swift`; these retained
regression tests are compiled by the sole test target. This ledger is included
as the adjacent provenance record. The import intentionally excludes the
upstream `.git`, build caches, automation/agent instructions, empty probe
directory, and the non-production `Examples` tree with branded configuration,
fonts, and sample media.

The Intatis root revision is the immutable identity for a distributed source
snapshot. Before release, rerun resolution, strict Mac/iOS builds, tests,
license/brand scans, and bundle inventory against that exact root revision.

## Upstream delta accounting at vendored import

These numbers describe the audited source delta imported from the candidate
tree relative to upstream `v0.6.0`; recompute them whenever the vendored source
or upstream basis changes:

- Tracked total: 331 files, 325 insertions, 5,616 deletions.
- Renderer/package source excluding `Resources/**`: 39 text files, 269
  insertions, 1,142 deletions.
- Derivative-owned production resources: 54 tracked asset/media files deleted;
  only the localization catalog remains. The later iosMath dependency's
  separately licensed resource bundle is outside this Microsoft upstream-delta
  count.
- Tracked test cleanup: 235 files changed/deleted, including 213 binary
  snapshots; remaining tracked text delta is 2 insertions and 3,168 deletions.
- New retained validation sources, not included in Git's unstaged diff count:
  `CandidatePhase2MatrixTests.swift` (342 lines) and
  `FirstReleaseContractTests.swift` (111 lines).
- Scratch-only probe source and the public probe product/target have been
  removed; they contribute zero files to the release candidate.

The 54 resource deletions and 235 test/snapshot changes are mechanical
repository thinning. They must not be presented as 289 files of renderer
redesign; the auditable implementation surface is the 39-file source delta
above, plus manifest/README and the two new test files.

## Conditions for deleting the fork patch

Replace this derivative with an official release only when one audited upstream
revision provides all of the following, or equivalent demonstrably safe APIs:

1. `swift-markdown` 0.8.0 or newer and the required malformed-table behavior.
2. Strict Swift 6.2+ concurrency with no unchecked/unsafe assertion on the
   parser/config/document transfer boundary.
3. Supported off-main parse followed by single-owner `@MainActor` installation,
   without document-bearing actor or AsyncStream storage.
4. Optional math, highlighting, images, citations, branded resources, and
   associated dependencies independently gated and removable; if math is
   present, its engine/resources must remain exact-pinned, code-aware,
   license-complete, and separable from the other disabled features.
5. A bounded paragraph-view cache with a supported zero-retention mode.
6. A native, keyboard- and accessibility-operable, byte-exact code-copy button.
7. Passing strict Mac/iOS builds plus functional, accessibility, memory, and
   streaming-performance evidence at least equivalent to the fork.

When every condition is met, pin the official immutable revision, update
notices and provenance, rerun the full Intatis cutover suite, and delete the
corresponding local patch groups rather than carrying duplicate implementations.
